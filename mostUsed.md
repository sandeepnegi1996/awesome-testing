List 
- [Form Filler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/form-filler/bnjjngeaknajbdcgpfkgnonkmififhfo) - Large forms can be really irritating to fill out each time, speed it up with dummy data.

1. Above mentioned extension is helpful for me in most of the cases since in my project i need to test so many fields and filling a form 
again and again is very cumbersome. I will configure this extension more on my requirements.
2. It can be used in both firefox and chrome.
